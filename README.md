## What is Stick Sans?

Stick Sans is a font I created using scans of lino prints I made! This font isn't complete and is very much my first time creating a usable font so apolocheese for any issues like kerning not working in like photoshop or word but most applications (i tested adobe indesign and it worked as well as my friend un testing it in libre office).
