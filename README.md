## What is Stick Sans?

Stick Sans is a sans serif font I created using scans of a lino print alphabet, giving it its rough and unique texturing.

## For Your Information

This is my first attempt at properly making a font so I am aware there are lots of missing characters and potential issues but you should be able to work around it (this font is more intented for use in designs or like as titles).

 I've also attached the original lino print scan (plus all the other lino prints I printed + scanned) for if anyone decides they want to try to make their own version of stick sans (as I am releasing this font + the scans under creative commons (if you do make a derivative font PLEASE LET ME KNOW THAT SOUNDS SO COOL!!)

## Known Issues

I am aware the kerning likes to just not work in photoshop or microsoft word. If anyone knows how to fix this LET ME KNOW PLEASE I AM STUCK I DO NOT KNOW anyways lol
